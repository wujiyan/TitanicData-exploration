# TitanicData-exploration
The data set contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. One can view a description of this dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Since it is a dataset regarding Titanic, I was curious about what kind of passengers could survive. Therefore I set my question as what factors affected passengerâ€™s survival. It is a big problem. After carefully studying the dataset, I divided the question into several smaller part.

Did passenger gender affected survival and how? 

Did passenger class affected survival and how?

Did parch affected survival and how?

Did passenger age affected survival and how?

By solving these problems, I tried to restore what was happening on board and how people got survived.
