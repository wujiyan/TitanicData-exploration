# TitanicData-exploration
The data set contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. One can view a description of this dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
Since it is a dataset regarding Titanic, I was curious about what kind of passengers could survive. Therefore I set my question as what factors affected passenger’s survival. It is a big problem. After carefully studying the dataset, I divided the question into several smaller part.
•	Did passenger gender affected survival and how? 
•	Did passenger class affected survival and how?
•	Did parch affected survival and how?
•	Did passenger age affected survival and how?
By solving these problems, I tried to restore what was happening on board and how people got survived.
